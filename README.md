# Data Product Class Project
This is the final project for the Data Products Class and requires a shiny app to be built to visually present the data.
The assignment requires a slide presentation that explains what the shiny app does .  The presentation itself will have a link to the shiny app 
and to my git hub account for the server.r and ui.r code that I wrote for my shiny app.

I chose the USArrest dataset from the dataset library in R.  This dataset contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents 
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

The shiny app I created displays a choropleth map of the United States based on the crime that the user selects.  The user is also 
able to view the USArrests data abd a summary for the types of crimes.
